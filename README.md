Detailed Regression models implementing PCA, bagging and boosting techniques.

NOTE: Attached is a ZIP file for Regression. I have also attached HTML version of python notebook for ease of cose access.


Regression Tasks are performed in the following code: 
 1. Bagging -  Linear Regression and Lasso 
 2. Pasting - KNN, Ridge
 3. Ada Boosting - Linear SVM, SVM kernel = rbf
 4. Gradient Boosting - Decision Tree
 5. Neural Networks
 6. PCA 


Classification Tasks are performed in the following code: 
 1. Soft voting classifier -  KNN, logistic regression, lgistic regression with lasso
 2. Hard Voting - SVC, KNN
 3. Bagging - KNN
 4. Pasting - SVC linear Kerner , SVC kernel RBF
 5. Gradient Boosting - Decision Tree Classifier
 6. Ada Boosting Classifier - Linear SVC, Kernel Poly SVC
 7. Deep Neural networks 
 8. PCA
