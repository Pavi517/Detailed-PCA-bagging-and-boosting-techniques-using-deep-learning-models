# Detailed-PCA-bagging-and-boosting-techniques-using-deep-learning-models
Detailed Regression models implementing PCA, bagging and boosting techniques.


Regression Tasks are performed in the following code: 
 1. Bagging -  Linear Regression and Lasso 
 2. Pasting - KNN, Ridge
 3. Ada Boosting - Linear SVM, SVM kernel = rbf
 4. Gradient Boosting - Decision Tree
 5. Neural Networks
 6. PCA
